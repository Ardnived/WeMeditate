# An duration is the rough length of a Meditation.
# This is to let users filter meditations by how much time they have available.

# TYPE: FILTER
# A duration is considered to be a "Filter", which is used to categorize the Meditation model

class DurationFilter < ApplicationRecord

  # Extensions

  # Concerns

  # Validations

  # Scopes
  default_scope { order(:minutes) }
  scope :q, -> (q) { where(minutes: q) if q.present? }
