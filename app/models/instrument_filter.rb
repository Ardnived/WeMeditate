# An instrument filter signals what sounds are being used in a music Track,
# so that users can filter Tracks for just the kind of music they want to listen to.
# Eg. Sitar, Piano, Voice, Drums, etc

# TYPE: FILTER
# A goal is considered to be a "Filter", which is used to categorize the Track model
